			<p>Welcome to my website. Let me tell you a little about my professional background: I am an IT Professional, primarily as a project manager.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Telecommunications Management. I have my PMP (Project Management Professional) certification and CSM (Certified Scrum Master) certification. Technology is constantly changing which is a big reason I got into this career area: I enjoy learning new skills and using the analytics side of my brain.</p>
			<p>Personally, I enjoy golfing, biking, walking, traveling, TV binge watching; and spending time with friends and neighbors during backyard summer outings.  I grew up on a farm in Kansas (where I learned what hard work was all about) and then moved to Minnesota in 1990 were I started my career as a Telecommunications Engineer. </p>
